						<h2>The Challenge<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
						<p>Flat Track Roller Derby is a fast-growing and exciting sport. It can also be utterly baffling for first-time spectators. As of 2016, the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association counted 381 Full Member Leagues and 66 apprentice leagues. Active derby participants nationwide are estimated in the tens of thousands. Only relatively small portions of derby spectators are aware of the rules and subtle tactical intricacies of the sport. While there is a “rules” app for referees and coaches, a “minimum skills” app for novice participants, and penalty timer apps for those administering an event but there are no apps for derby spectators.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The challenge was to solve that problem by designing a mobile application that helps roller derby spectators understands what they are seeing and following the action. The project was focus on immersion, research, and first-time user flows.<strong></strong></p>

						<h2>The approach<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My lack of domain knowledge in roller derby meant I needed to understand the nature of the sport, pain points of novice spectators and how did spectators gain roller knowledge in the first place quickly and throughly. During the research phase, I conducted market analysis on existing roller derby education app but then to discover currently there are no apps that target roller derby spectators. Because the lack of roller derby education app in the market, I seeked to learn about how other alternative sports mobile app such as rugby and lacrosse gear toward novice and experienced spectators.</p></br>
					<p>To access our prospective users, I went to a roller derby event to talk to fans, players and referees. This allowed me to quickly understand the challenges novice spectators faced when they first started watching the game. Since it was hard to find and identify spectators who were newbies, I brought my friend who had no previous knowledge of the sport to the event. And I observed his reactions and frustrations he encountered when he watched his first roller derby game.</p></br>

					<p>Because roller derby is an international sport, I developed a survey to understand roller derby's subcultural ethos, attitude and their scope of interest of the game to see were users only interested in knowing more about the local roller derby scenes or the sport as a whole in a international level.</p>

						<blockquote>"You can't just walk down the street and says that's a roller derby player. The culture is very grassroots ... there's the DIY culture, everybody does it themselves, they do their own t-shirts, leagues, get their practices, they put on a show, there's a lot of productions on putting on the show. It's about the community, the alternative culture...building the league and community together. It's not just about tattoos, there are definitely people with tattoos but there are still mild mannered, quiet people. It is super diverse." <p>- Mo/Quadzilla, Team USA Men's Roller Derby Player</p></blockquote>
					    </br>
						<blockquote>"It is a community that accepts all sexual orientation and all non-man-gender sports. It has a broad definition of what it means to be a woman sport, which is wonderful. It is like a judgment free zone. Not even for once that I feel like I would be unwelcomed." <p>- Dana/Hydraulic Tess, Roller derby player<p></blockquote>

						<h2>The Discovery<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Insights form our discovery work indicated since the sport is relatively new, the rules and the strategies change all the time. Often, even seasoned spectators and players do not know all the rules and subtle tactical intricacies of the sport.</p>
					<p>Spectators mostly learnt about the rules and strategies of the sports from the word of mouth. For newbies who have no immediate connections with people who have previous roller derby knowledge, the learning curve was really steep when they first started watching the game.</p>
					<p>I also discovered that spectators watched both online and offline games where an app that has easy look up on concised explanation of the rules, strategies and plays could help improve spectators understanding of the game drastically.</p>

						<h2>The Planing &amp Making<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To avoid feature-itis, I created a persona that closely resembles the interviewees and empathy map to help me relate and understand the end users and see things from their perspectives. </p>
					<p>Before starting any design, I spent my time to figure out the userflows and requirements of the application. This involved creating a UX strategy blueprint that captures the goals and vision that I had with the proposed solution and  a feature matrix document to select the key features to implement on the app. And based on the workflows, I used Sketch to create sets of mid-fidelity prototypes to test my assumptions via InVision.</p>
				</br>
				    <h3>Focus of the app</h3>
					</br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>Create a user a friendly and informative tool that helps spectators understand the rules and subtle tactical intricacies of the game in a deeper level</li>
							<li>Make searching for local matches and roller derby related information more effortless and less steps process</li>
							<li>Create a mobile application that helps roller derby spectators understand what they are seeing and follow the action</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>
					 <h3>Aspirations</h3>
					 </br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>Increase awareness of the sport</li>
							<li>Present a smooth experience for roller derby spectators when they use the app while watching live or offline games</li>
							<li>Enhance the immersion process to minimize the steps roller derby spectators need to look up rules, team informaiton and skater information</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>
					  <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
					 </br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>Use familiar, clear, concise UI elements to reduce learning curver for uses</li>
							<li>The app layout should be similar with other alternative sports app</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>
					 <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
					 </br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>The measure of success will be determined by improvements in the ability of a novice spectator to track and grasp the progress of a match</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>

						<h2>Verifying<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To test the usability of the new derby app, I conducted remote usability test and recruited multiple novice roller derby spectators to validate user behavior assumptions and identify potential design concerns in order to improve the end-user satisfaction. </p>
					<p>The test goals are the following</p>
				    <ul class="default">
						<li>Evaluate the usability and flow of the app</li>
						<li>Identify the pain points participants have when they are using the app</li>
						<li>Determine how difficult is it for first time user to understand the navigation of the app </li>
						<li>Observe user’s understanding of the tool</li>
						<li>Determine the improvement in the ability of a novice spectator to track and grasp the progress of a match after using the prototype</li>
					 </ul>
					 <p>Besides testing each tester’s ability to complete specific assigned tasks, the goal of the app is to improve novice spectator understanding of the sport and help them track and grasp the progress of a match. To test the improvement the app brought to the spectators, I showed them a video of a bout and asked them to respond to a few roller derby related questions without the help of the app. After the first showing of the video clip, I then provided them my prototype to use while watching the same roller derby video once more and observed any improvement on their understanding of the progress of the game.</p>
					 <p>Overall, the testing went very well. Before using the prototype, users got ≅1 question correct.  After using the prototype, 90% of the users got all the questions right. The test completion rate was over 90%. Users thought the UI of the new feature is familiar and consistent with the current user interface of the other sport apps and they thought the user flow is smooth and intuitive.</p>

						<h2>UI Design<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After I went through a few rounds of wireframe iterations based on user testing results and feedback. I moved on to exploring Derby Power's identity. I created a mood board based on how users describe the sport during the research. The keywords that appeared the most during the interviews and survey were: alternative, inclusive, diverse, welcoming and bold.</p>
					<p>The designs used pink gradient as the dominant color with a few color accents to bring out the clean and bold interace. The color choices used are vibrant and eye-catching, which represents the sport is special and authetic.</p>
					<p>For the logo, I developed a mascot for the brand: Derby, a unicorn that skates. I decided to use unicorn because it  symbolizes the uniqueness and athleticism of the sport. And the rainbow represents the inclusive community the sport brings.</p>
