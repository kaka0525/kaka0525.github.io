						<h2>The approach<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To have a more holistic understanding of the pain points and usage trends of the user trends, I interviewed five music streaming services users. In addtion to that, I <b>conducted online survey to understand user's habits on sharing music</b> and discover ways that people relate to music. There are many music-streaming apps so a thorough <b>competitive analysis</b> was also in order.</br>

						<h2>The Discovery<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Here are some key insights I learnt from the research.</p>
					<strong>Convenience Comes First</strong>
					<p>Users are interested in knowing recommendations of music from Spotify, friends or people that share similar music taste and they like to share music if it is effortless and convenient.</p>
				    <strong>Social features are underused</strong>
					<p>In general, Spotify social features are underused because users are not aware of them or their friends are not using them.</p>
				    <strong>Pure Music Lovers</strong>
					<p>Some users are not keen on social features so having the options to turn off the feature is important.</p>
					<strong>Shared songs have to be liked</strong>
					<p>Users share music to their friends only when they are certain their friends will enjoy the music</p>

						<h2>The Vision and Ideation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>From the research I learnt that there are needs for users to know about their friend’s musical taste before they feel comfortable sharing music with them. Sometimes <b>users hesitate to share music because they are afraid that the music they shared won’t be like</b>. The research points to <b>the need of creating a music profile that serves as a reference tool for users to keep track of their and their friend's musical tastes </b>before they decide to share music.</p>
					<p>My vision for the new feature was to present a smooth experience for users to share and find music. Users currently lack of an informative reference tool that keep track of their musical taste. The new feature would improve the current music sharing experience to be <b>more seamless with the current Spotify listening experience</b>. When users want to share music with their friends, they can refer to their friend’s music sharing history and music taste before they share.</p>
				</br>
				    <h3>Focus of the app</h3>
					</br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>Creates a user friendly and informative tool that depicts a user’s musical taste and sharing history, which helps Spotify and user friend’s find  more accurate music suggestion</li>
							<li>Makes music sharing experience more effortless and less steps process</li>
							<li>Creates a visualization tool of user’s musical taste</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>
					 <h3>Aspirations</h3>
					 </br>
				    	<ul class="default">
							<li>Increases awareness and usage of the social features on Spotify</li>
							<li>Presents a smooth experience for users to share and find music</li>
							<li>Improves the current music sharing experience to be more seamless with the current Spotify listening experience</li>
							<li>Enhances the music discovery process to minimize the steps users have to take to see suggested/recommended music and playlists</li>
					    </ul>
					 </br>
					  <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
					   <p>When I was designing the user interface, I had to make sure the layout would be <b>consistent with current Spotify visual and UI design</b> and ensured the UI elements for the feature are familiar, clear and concise to <b>reduce learning curves</b> for users</p>
					 </br>
					 <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
					 </br>
				    	<ul class="default">
				    		<li>Increases use of social features for sharing music by 10%</li>
							<li>Increases user satisfaction by 10%</li>
					    </ul>

						<h2>The Planing &amp Making<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To <b>avoid scope creep</b>, it was important to <b>narrowly define the feature</b> that is going to be added and <b>rely on the persona and empathy map</b> to understand the needs and wants of the users.</p>
					<p>Based on the surveys and interviews conducted, users want to share music but they hesitate to do so because they are worried about the music they shared won’t be liked. The worries and rejection of their  music preferences is the main deterrent for them to share music. To address the problem, I designed <b>a virtual representation tool that captures a user’s music taste</b> based on what they listened to and the music that were shared with them.</p>
					<p>The design process of the virtualization tool was challenging but rewarding. I talked to my mentor from DesignLab on the idea of a visual music profile. Then he introduced me to <a href="https://immersion.media.mit.edu/"> Immersion </a>, a tool created by MIT Media lab that uses one’s email metadata and turn them into a visual map.</p>
					<p>The tool I was designing draws some parallels with Immersion, they both provide a <b>human-centric view on data</b>. For Immersion, it was for e-mail. And for the Spotify music profile, it was for musical taste and music sharing history.</p>
					<p>After I got some design ideas from immersion, I opted to sketch out the music profile design on paper. This helped me to consider more ideas and led me to think about all the moving parts on the app that led to a more cohesive design.

						<h2>Verifying<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To determine the usability of the feature user interface and identify potential design concerns, I conducted <b>remote testing and usability tests</b> to <b>validate user behavior assumptions</b>.</p>
					<p>The feature depends heavily on visual and data representation. The main test goals were to <b>observes user’s understanding of the visuals on the map</b> (ex. The different node sizes represent the frequency of an user listen to that particular type of music) and<b>observe their gestural interaction with the prototype</b> when they complete assigned tasks like panning in and panning out to zoom in and out on the visual map.</p>
					<p>The main negative feedback during the usability tests were  the navigation to the music profile was not obvious and the sharing button was not noticeable and clear enough. After a few rounds of the iteration on the wireframes, the completion rate was over 90%</p>
					<p>Since the feature is very visual, the design of how the contents are display is really important. I created <b>3 potential UI designs</b> and <b>conducted A/B testing</b> to get some feedback.</p>
					<p>The final result is a visual tool that allows users to see their friend’s music taste and music sharing history before sharing music and a tool that can easily see suggested music suggestion</p>

						<h3>A/B Test<br />
						</h3>
						 <p>Option 1 and Option 2 both had 40% of the votes. People who chose option 1 thought it is the most visual and easy to understand design. People who chose option 2 noted that in his words, ' I prefer a mix of pictures of famous artists and the names instead of pictures for less famous artists shown within the category circles within this design option. I also liked the fade out colored edges around the circles for the lesser-known artists'. Even though option 3 received the least amount of votes, the testing participants raised a good question on <b>accessibility on the UI</b>. In his words, 'I think this will be the most clear. I don't have great facial recognition so I prefer words.'</p>
					<p>To keep the accessibility factor in mind while not compromising on the aesthetic of the feature, I <b>added the ability for users to look up the artist’s names after the musician's pictures being clicked</b>.</p>

					<p> The new feature would <b>improve the current music sharing experience </b>to be more <b>seamless with the current Spotify listening experience</b>. It presents a visual map of the user’s most frequent listened songs and sharing history —anyone with whom users shared music more than three times will become part of the visual graph and it is represents as a node of the graph. And the <b>larger circles indicate there are higher volumes of records of that specific genre of music being listening to</b>. </p><br>
