						<h2>The Challenge<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Instashop is a Seattle grocery store franchise. Although the company has moderate success the past few years, their market shares have been decreasing by 8% each year. The company believes that the decline is due to the online grocery ordering. Now it hopes to grow their share and meet their customer needs by allowing their customers to buy their products online.</p>
					<p>Instashop now approached me with a primary objective to create an online platform for the company.<strong></strong></p>

						<h2>The approach<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To understand the Seattle market and what drives customers to online grocery shopping, I interviewed and sent out a survey to usual grocery shoppers and conducted competitive analysis on other online grocery service provider to get a better understand of the problem space. </p>
					<br />
					<h3>Methods and outputs:</h3><p>Survey, Competitve Analysis, Interviews, Interview Guide, Research Plan, Project Plan</p>

						<h2>The Discovery<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Here are some key insights I learnt from the research.</p>
					<ul class="default">
					<li>People who chose online grocery shopping tends to be working professional that value their time and enjoy the convenience the service brings. </li>
					<li>The three major factors for users to choose a specific grocery store are the location, the food quality and the travel time to the store.</li>
					<li>The most enjoyable part of the in store grocery shopping experience are the food samples, finding deals and able to see the items. </li>
					<li>The most enjoyable part of online grocery shopping experience are the ease of browsing multiple items and the same time and the time it takes. </li>
					</ul>
					 <p>Since the online grocery market is still developing, I wanted to see how receptive users are to new technology.  One of the most interesting findings I got was that around 15% of the target audience were not interested in trying new technology at all even if their surroundings and their friends are using it, which was in contrast with my prior assumption that people would be willing to try our new technology if it became popular.</p>
					 <p>I discussed the findings with my mentor and I learnt about the diffusion of innovation that there are always laggards. It is extremely expensive to spend money to change their minds so the design should focus on the early adopters and the majority. With that in mind, I focused on designing a enjoyable shopping experience for the main audience.</p>

						<h2>The Planing &amp Making<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Based on the research, I created a persona based on the questionnaires and secondary research on who are the targeted customers for online shopping. The persona is a working dad that loves new technology that brings convenience to his life. He is interested in online grocery shopping but he is waiting for the service to mature before giving Instashop a try. To understand more of the user's needs, pain points, gains and needs, I used my interviews and questionnaire findings to create an empathy map to depict my persona's emotional state. </p>
					<p>To arrive at a deeper understanding of the problem space, I looked at how the other competitions are currently trying to solve the problem and evaluated how expensive they are. I then summarized what Instashop has to offer and how it works and compiled a list of possible features. With the list of product features, I prioritized them by their level of importance to the business and its users. After I synthesized the research result, I built a set of wireframes of the site.</p>

					<h3>Methods and outputs:</h3><p>Persona, Empathy map, Feature Matrix, Storyboard, Competitive analysis, Business and users diagram</p>

						<h2>Verifying<br />
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To test my assumptions, I conducted usability tests with my mid-fidelity wireframes in InVision. The test goals were to evaluate the usability and flow of the shopping experience, identify the pain points participants had when they were using  the app and determined how difficult was it for first time shopper to understand the navigation of the app. </p>
					 <p>I recruited 3 participants to complete common usual online shoppers' tasks on the prototype. I documented the feedbacks, inefficiencies, user errors that I found during testing.</p>
					 <p>I went through my notes that I compiled during my prototype research testing sessions and created an affinity map and improvement plans to address the negative feedbacks. The feedback were mostly positive. Testers think the prototype is easy to use and navigate and they had no trouble completing the check out process. One of the major negative feedback I got from users that the navigation bar that contained only words was not helpful. What I learnt was that users tend not to read the contents so they often missed or had to double check the categories before they got to the link's destination they wanted. To improve that I added icons right next to each navigation destination. And after few rounds of iterations, the passing rate was over 80%.</p>
